# Warehouse Management Implementation for TSmart Quality

## Overview

This implementation adds warehouse management capabilities to the TSmart Quality backend API, enabling users to manage warehouses, locations, shelves, and inventory. The system follows the existing project's patterns for controllers, routes, authentication, and validation.

## Database Schema Extensions

Added the following tables to the database schema:

1. **warehouse_locations**: For managing zones/locations within a warehouse
   - Key fields: name, code, description, warehouse_id, zone_code, floor_level, is_pickup_point, is_receiving_point, capacity metrics

2. **warehouse_shelves**: For managing shelves within warehouse locations
   - Key fields: name, code, description, warehouse_id, location_id, shelf_level, shelf_position, capacity metrics, is_active, is_blocked

3. **warehouse_inventory**: For tracking product inventory in warehouses
   - Key fields: product_id, warehouse_id, location_id, shelf_id, quantity, reserved_quantity, available_quantity, lot_number, batch_number, expiry dates

## Implemented Controllers

1. **warehouse.controller.ts**: CRUD operations for warehouses
   - getAllWarehouses, getWarehouseById, createWarehouse, updateWarehouse, deleteWarehouse
   - getPaginatedWarehouses, getFilteredWarehouses, getWarehouseFilterItems, getWarehouseDashboard

2. **warehouseLocation.controller.ts**: CRUD operations for warehouse locations
   - getAllWarehouseLocations, getLocationsByWarehouseId, getWarehouseLocationById
   - createWarehouseLocation, updateWarehouseLocation, deleteWarehouseLocation
   - getPaginatedLocations, getFilteredLocations

3. **warehouseShelf.controller.ts**: CRUD operations for warehouse shelves
   - getAllWarehouseShelves, getShelvesByWarehouseId, getShelvesByLocationId, getWarehouseShelfById
   - createWarehouseShelf, updateWarehouseShelf, deleteWarehouseShelf
   - getPaginatedShelves, getFilteredShelves

4. **warehouseInventory.controller.ts**: Operations for inventory management
   - getInventoryByWarehouseId, getInventoryByProductId, getInventoryByShelfId, getInventoryById
   - addToInventory, updateInventoryItem, deleteInventoryItem
   - moveInventory (transactional operation for moving stock between locations)
   - getPaginatedInventory, getFilteredInventory

## API Routes

Created corresponding route files with validation and authentication:

1. **warehouse.routes.ts**: Routes for warehouse operations
2. **warehouseLocation.routes.ts**: Routes for warehouse location operations
3. **warehouseShelf.routes.ts**: Routes for warehouse shelf operations
4. **warehouseInventory.routes.ts**: Routes for inventory operations

All routes are registered in app.ts with the following endpoints:
- `/api/v1/warehouses`
- `/api/v1/warehouse-locations`
- `/api/v1/warehouse-shelves`
- `/api/v1/inventory`

## Design Decisions

1. **Multi-Tenancy Support**: All controllers enforce company-level data isolation using the `company_id` from the authenticated user's context.

2. **Soft Deletion Pattern**: Followed the existing pattern of soft deletes by setting the `status` field to `false` rather than physically removing records.

3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Implemented a three-level hierarchy for warehouse management:
   - Warehouse → Locations → Shelves
   - This allows for flexible organization of warehouse space

4. **Inventory Management**:
   - Tracks total quantity, reserved quantity, and available quantity
   - Supports lot numbers and batch numbers for traceability
   - Provides expiry date tracking for perishable items
   - Includes a transactional "move" operation for transferring stock between locations

5. **Pagination and Filtering**: All list endpoints support pagination and advanced filtering to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Frontend Integration

The implementation aligns with the frontend components found in:
- `/src/components/warehouse/WarehousePage.tsx`
- `/src/components/warehouse/WarehouseList.tsx`
- `/src/components/warehouse/locations/LocationsPage.tsx`
- `/src/components/warehouse/shelves/ShelvesPage.tsx`

The API endpoints provide all the data needed by these frontend components.

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All routes require authentication via the `authenticate` middleware.

2. **Validation**: Input validation is applied to all endpoints using express-validator.

3. **Authorization**: The company ID from the authenticated user is used to restrict access to data.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Migration**: Run the SQL schema extensions to create the new tables.

2. **Frontend Implementation**: Connect the frontend components to the new API endpoints.

3. **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests for the new controllers and routes.

4. **Documentation**: Update the API documentation with the new endpoints using Swagger.

5. **Reporting**: Implement inventory reporting features for stock levels, movements, and expiry dates.
